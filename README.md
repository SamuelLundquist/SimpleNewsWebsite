# SimpleNewsWebsite
Simple news website from tutorial by **RaddyTheBrand** on Youtube with my own twist. It uses Node.js Express and EJS to provide a streamlined ad-free browsing experience, allowing you too look at the latest and most popular headlines from around the web.

This build is displaying the most popular headlines in the US that are in English. More could be achieved with a few adjustments to the newsapi calls, but I tailored this for personal use.

I styled the website with bootstrap and icons from font awesome. Deployed the app to Render with the api key for newsapi as an environment variable.

## Result
You can find this website hosted at: https://nodejs-news.onrender.com/

## Try on your own
If you wish to try out this web app locally, you will need to provide a api key from: https://newsapi.org/

This key needs to be added to **_'news.js'_**
